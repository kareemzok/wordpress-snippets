## Introduction

The custom code in wordpress, helps you write customized code to alter WordPress funcitonaility. It is written in [php].

## Installation

Here are three main methods for adding custom code to WordPress:

1. Child Theme Functions.php: This method involves editing the functions.php file of a child theme.
Child themes are a way to customize a WordPress theme without modifying the original theme files. 
This is a good method for adding small snippets of code that are specific to your site.

2. Code Snippets Plugin: This method involves using a plugin like Code Snippets or Insert Headers and Footers. 
These plugins allow you to add snippets of code without having to edit theme files. This is a good method for adding code that needs to be run on all pages of your site.

3. Custom Plugin: This method involves creating a custom plugin to add your code. 
Custom plugins are more complex than child themes or code snippets plugins, but they give you more control over where and how your code is run.
This is a good method for adding complex code or code that needs to interact with other plugins or themes.
